## *Overview*
- The following dataset contaion information about the layoffs across various industries across the globe from March 2020 - March 2023.
- This project mainly focuses on Data Cleaning, EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) and extracting actionable insights.
- I personally did this project as I was keen to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on different Industry Sectors.

## *Steps Performed*
_Outline the key steps I followed in this Project:_ <br>

1. **Data Cleaning :** <br>
 (a). Remove Duplicates<br>
 (b). Standardize the Data<br>
 (c). Null Values and Blank Values<br>
 (d). Remove Any Column<br>

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) :** <br>
 (a). Analyzed the data and identified companies with a layoff percentage of 1, indicating that they laid off entire workforce.<br>
 (b). Analyzed the data to identify which comapny, industry, country and stage had the highest number of layoffs.<br>
 (c). Analyzed the data to identify the specific months or years when the most layoffs took place with the help of rolling total.<br>
 (d). Also analyzed the data around specific period when COVID-19 waves hit the world.<br>
