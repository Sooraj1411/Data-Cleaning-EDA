# **DATA ANALYSIS ON LAYOFFS DATA (MARCH 2020 - MARCH 2023)**


## *Overview*
- The following dataset contaion information about the layoffs across various industries across the globe from March 2020 - March 2023.
- This project mainly focuses on Data Cleaning, EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) and extracting actionable insights.
- I personally did this project as I was keen to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on different Industry Sectors.

## *Project Goals*

- Cleaning and preprocessing raw data for analysis.
- Analyzing layoff trends over the three-year period.
- Identifying the industries or locations most affected by layoffs.
- Detecting seasonal trends or anomalies in layoffs.


## *Steps Performed*
_Outline the key steps I followed in this Project:_ <br>

1. **Data Cleaning :**
   + Remove Duplicates
   + Standardize the Data
   + Null Values and Blank Values
   + Remove Any Column

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) :** <br>
   + Analyzed companies with a layoff percentage of 100%, indicating they laid off their entire workforce.<br>
   + Identified companies, industries, countries, and stages with the highest number of layoffs.<br>
   + Analyzed specific months or years with the highest number of layoffs using rolling totals.<br>
   + Analyzed layoff trends during specific COVID-19 waves.<br>

4. **INSIGHTS :** <br>
   + Out of almost 2000 companies, more that 100 companies laid off their entire workforce.<br>
   + Over the course of 3 years,In companies, industries, stages, countries -> Amazon, Consumer, Post-IPO and United States had the most laid offs.<br>
   + The year 2022 saw the highest number of layoffs, with over 160k employees laid off.<br>
   + Google had the most layoffs (12k) at once in January 2021.<br>
   + Despite only having data for three months of 2023, the year already had the second-highest number of layoffs, with more than 125k employees. This indicates that 2023 is likely to surpass 2022 in total layoffs.<br>


## *Tools Used*
- Used Microsoft Excel for validating the data.
- Used SQL for Data Cleaning & EDA.
- Platform - MySQL.

  ## *How to Use :*
 Include instructions for someone who wants to replicate your work: <br>
 - Download the [layoffs.csv](https://github.com/Sooraj1411/Data-Cleaning-EDA/blob/main/layoffs.csv) file provided in the project.
 - Import the data in MySQL after creating a database.
 - Run the [Data Cleaning Queries](https://github.com/Sooraj1411/Data-Cleaning-EDA/blob/main/Data%20Cleaning%20the%20layoff%20file.sql) and then [EDA](https://github.com/Sooraj1411/Data-Cleaning-EDA/blob/main/EDA.sql) queries to get desired outputs.
