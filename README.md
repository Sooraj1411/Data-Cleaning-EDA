## *Steps Performed*
_Outline the key steps I followed in this Project:_ <br>

1. **Data Cleaning :** <br>
 (a). Remove Duplicates<br>
 (b). Standardize the Data<br>
 (c). Null Values and Blank Values<br>
 (d). Remove Any Column<br>

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) :** <br>
 (a). Analyzed the data and identified companies with a layoff percentage of 1, indicating that they laid off entire workforce.<br>
 (b). Analyzed the data to identify which comapny, industry, country and stage had the highest number of layoffs.<br>
 (c). Analyzed the data to identify the specific months or years when the most layoffs took place with the help of rolling total.<br>
 (d). Also analyzed the data around specific period when COVID-19 waves hit the world.<br>

3. **INSIGHTS :** <br>
   (a). Out of almost 2000 companies, more that 100 companies laid off their entire workforce.<br>
   (b). Over the course of 3 years,In companies, industries, stages, countries -> Amazon, Consumer, Post-IPO and United States had the most laid offs.<br>
   (c).Year 2022, the companies had most laid offs with more than 160k.<br>
   (d). Google had the most laid offs (12000) at once in JAN 2021.<br>
   (e). Despite having only 3 months of Data of 2023, the year 2023 had 2nd most laid offs of more than 125k which indicates that year 2023 will have the most laid offs since 2020.<br>
